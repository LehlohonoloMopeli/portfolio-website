                                I am a deeply passionate software developer who continuously improves his skills. I was born 
                                and am still based in Johannesburg, South Africa. I have good understanding of finance, mathematics, and
                                mathematical statistics as a result of completing two years of studies in an Actuarial Science
                                degree. The combination of good math skills and programming make me a great at solving 
                                technical problems. I am also a fan of art, beauty and aesthetics, which is why I like and 
                                develop front-end for software as well.
